      content: |
        Space Next Door ("SND") takes the maintenance of trust and security within our community very seriously.  Hence, we are taking this opportunity to publish our standards and values for all members to share.
        SND offers a number of elements to support the development of trust and security amongst our users.
      policies:
        - section: "SECTION 1:  SAFETY"
          content: |
            As a community, we are very focused on the safety of all of our members.  To achieve this, we require everyone to work towards a safe, secure environment for all.

            Read carefully

            Look at the profiles and review of Hosts before you book.  Ensure that they have verified phone numbers and are connected to social networks.
            Please read the Host’s description of their listing along with their house rules so that you fully understand what they want and what they are offering. Please also make sure that you have read and understood the host's cancellation policy before making a reservation too.
          subjects:
            - title: Pay and communicate on SND
              content: |
                Paying or communicating with Hosts outside our system makes it more difficult for us to protect your personal information and puts you at greater risk of fraud and other security issues. For this reason, we prohibit paying for a reservation outside our Site in our Terms of Service and discourage communication outside our messaging system.

                We strongly recommend that you use our messaging system before a booking to confirm details about features, access, house rules and other Users who may be sharing the space.  You can also use it to make arrangements for moving in to your space.
            - title : Set clear expectations
              content: |
                It is always a good idea to speak with the Host about what you intend to do with the space and what you can expect after you move in.  If you don’t feel right about a reservation, we suggest that you find another space.  If a communication with a Host makes you feel uncomfortable or you need help during your reservation, let us know.
            - title: Please be considerate
              content: |
                Whether you're still looking for the perfect listing or are already on your way, being a considerate guest matters.

                <strong>Remember:</strong> In an emergency situation, or if your personal safety is threatened, contact local police or emergency services immediately.
            - title: Ensure that the space you occupy is hazard free
              content: |
                You should not do anything that may increase the likelihood of a fire or impede escape in the event of emergency.

                In addition, the Host as the owner of the property, is entitled to set the access, terms and conditions of rental.
              unorder_lists:

          content: |

                Do not take or damage property that belongs to others or make use of their property without permission.  This includes making copies of keys or taking access codes.  In most jurisdictions, it is illegal to make and keep copies of identity documents, stay on in a listing after your stay is concluded or threaten anyone with bad ratings or negative publicity or harm to obtain compensation or other benefit.
            - title: Spam, phishing, or fraud
              content: |
                You should not make transactions outside of SND’s payments system, commit credit card fraud or attempt to launder money through the Site.  Using SND to drive traffic to other sites or market unrelated products; diverting payments meant for others; or making false claims against other members are similarly not welcome in our community.
            - title: Home safety
              content: |
                Your safety is always a priority.  If a Host finds that a guest is breaking one of the House Rules that has been set or if you have made the Host feel unsafe through your actions, the Host may decline your reservation request or cancel an existing reservation.
            - title: Before you make a reservation
              content: |
                We encourage you to take advantage of the safety features that we've provided to give you peace of mind and help you get to know potential Hosts.
            - title: Cancelling a reservation
              content: |
                If you've already made a reservation, you can cancel it, subject to the published cancellation policy.
            - title: Flagging inappropriate messages
              content: |
                If a message from a Host makes you uncomfortable, let us know and we will review it and, if necessary address this with the Host.

                <strong>Remember:</strong> In an emergency situation, or if your personal safety is threatened, contact local police or emergency services immediately.
        - section: "SECTION 3:  ONLINE SECURITY"
          content: |
            Paying and communicating through SND helps ensure that you're protected under our Terms Of Service, cancellation and refund policies and Protection Insurance programme. It also makes it easy to find and reference important details like the Host’s rules, contact details, payment information and rental terms. We can’t provide these benefits if your reservation isn’t booked and paid for directly through SND.

            Paying or communicating outside of SND also makes it harder for us to protect your information and puts you at greater risk of fraud and other security issues.

            Never pay for your reservation or ongoing rental outside of SND.  For you safety and security, we strongly recommend that you keep all payments and communication through the SND website.  If someone asks you to pay for outside our on-site payment system, please let us know.

            If you receive an email directing you to a website that looks like SND but asks for confidential information, be cautious. When in doubt, always start from our home page. Simply type https://www.spacenextdoor.com in your browser.
          subjects:
            - title: Look for a lock icon in your browser
              content: |
                You can tell if a website is secure by looking for the image of a lock in your browser’s address bar. If you don’t see this image, your connection isn’t secure.  Do not enter any personal information.
            - title: Check the email address
              content: |
                You can tell if an email is really from SND by looking at what comes after the @ symbol. All official SND emails will come from an address that ends in @spacenextdoor.com.

                If you receive an email that looks like it's from SND, but doesn’t have the correct ending, it's very likely fake.  By making an email seem real, fraudsters hope to trick you into providing personal information that we would never ask for.  Don't click any of its links and delete the email immediately.

                If you encounter a suspicious profile, listing, or message thread, flag it for review. If someone emails you asking you to pay or accept payment off-site, let us know right away.

            - title: How will my email address look to other people?
              content: |
                Whilst we strongly recommend communicating using our messaging system, on occasion, you may need to use email to communicate with the Host.  We don't share your personal email address even after you have made a reservation. Instead, we create a temporary SND address for you, and share that with your Host. Keeping your real personal email address hidden helps protect privacy, and prevent unwanted communications.

                  Email sent to your temporary SND email are forwarded to your personal email address. This enables you to use your email account to send or reply to messages.
            - title: What if my SND account has been compromised?
              unorder_lists:
                list_title: "If you think your SND account has been compromised or that someone’s logging into it without your permission, you should immediately:"
                lists: ['Change your password', 'Check your account settings to make sure they are correct', 'Check to ensure that no changes have been made to your listings', 'Complete the profile verification steps', 'Reset your password and report the incident to SND via <a href="mailto:help@spacenextdoor.com">help@spacenextdoor.com</a>.']
        - section: "SECTION 4:  VERIFICATION"
          content: |
            Profile verifications are a way to connect your SND profile to other information about you, such as your Facebook profile, phone number, email address, or government-issued ID.

                How does providing identification on SND work?
                Verifying some information about guests and hosts on SND helps make our community a safer place for everyone. That’s why, in addition to requiring a profile photo, confirmed phone number, and confirmed email address, we might also ask you to provide an official ID and other related information.
            - title: When you'll need to provide ID
              content: |
                SND may ask you to provide ID for several reasons, including if you plan to book an experience or if a host requires that a guest provides ID before booking their place.

                If a host requires you to provide ID, only the guest making the booking will be required to provide ID, and you'll need to complete the process before your booking is confirmed. If you need to come back later, go to spacenextdoor.com/verify and pick up where you left off.
            - title: How it works
              content: |
                If you're asked to take a selfie, your government ID photo and selfie must match, and your ID must appear to be valid. If your photos don’t match, you’re under 18, or your ID doesn't appear to be valid, your reservation may be cancelled.
                Completing this process isn’t an endorsement of any host or guest, a guarantee of someone’s identity, or that interacting with them will be safe. Always use your own best judgement, and follow our safety tips for guests and hosts.
              unorder_lists:
                list_title: "When you’re asked to provide ID, you   might need to:"
                lists: ["Add a profile picture if you don’t have one already.", "Take a photo of your government-issued ID (ex: passport, driver’s license, national ID, or visa).", "Connect another online profile to your SND account, such as a Facebook account.", "Take a selfie. This needs to be a live photo taken during this process.", "Answer questions about yourself that only you would know the answer to."]
            - title: What gets shared with your host
              unorder_lists:
                list_title: "If you’re a guest and you’re asked to provide ID, your host will see:"
                lists: ["Your profile name and photo.", "Whether you’ve successfully completed this process.", "The full name on your government ID."]
            - title: Privacy
              content: |
                We take privacy seriously. The information you share with us is governed by our Privacy Policy.  Stripe, our payment partner, has their own comprehensive Privacy Policy, which you can see at <a href="https://stripe.com/sg/privacy">https://stripe.com/sg/privacy</a>.
            - title: What is required to book on SND?
              unorder_lists:
                list_title: |
                  We ask potential Guests for a few pieces of information before they book.  This information helps ensure Hosts know how their space will be used and also how to contact the guest.
                  SND’s registration requirements for guests include:
                lists: ["Full name", "Email address", "Confirmed phone number", "Government issued ID with photo (optional, upon request by , SND)", "Profile photo of the Guest", "Introductory message", "Agreement to house rules", "Payment information"]
            - title: How do I verify my phone number?
              content: |
                If you don’t see a confirmation message, try refreshing the page. If the method you chose isn't working, try the other one.
                After verifying your phone number, you can manage text message notifications by going to Account and choosing Notifications on the left. As always, standard message and data rates may apply for any calls or messages sent or received. For questions about these rates, get in touch with your phone provider.
              order_lists:
                lists: ["Go to Profile on spacenextdoor.com.", "Next to Phone Number, click Add a phone number.", "Use the drop-down menu to select your country, and we’ll automatically insert the right country code.", "Enter your area code and phone number.", "Click Verify via SMS. We'll send you a 4-digit code via text message (SMS).", "Enter your code and click Verify"]
            - title: Why verify?
              content: |
                Having a verified phone number gives Hosts, Guests and SND a confirmed way to contact each other about any issues related to your booking or your account. Hosts must verify their phone numbers before listing their space and Guests must likewise have a verified phone number before booking.
