          content: |
            Spacenextdoor.com is owned and operated by Space Next Door Singapore Pte Ltd (hereafter referred to as "SND", “The Company”, the “Website”, "we", "us", or "our"). SND is a website facilitating short term space rentals between Hosts and Guests.  “Host” is defined as the person advertising via the Website and providing a storage space for the Guest to store their belongings.  “Guest” is the person paying the storage and service fees and utilising the Space to store items belonging to them or in their possession.  Collectively, Guests and Hosts are referred to as “Users”. “Space” is the physical space at the Hosts’ address in which items are stored.

            SND is not itself a party to any such rental transaction, except where it has listed a Space and identified itself as a Host, and is otherwise not a contracting agent or representative of any Host, nor is it a rental agent or property broker, and as such, disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such transactions to the fullest extent permitted by law.

            SND collects and transfers payment from the Guest to the Host and solely acts on behalf of the Host for collecting payment. The spaces available on our Website are not owned or operated by SND, except where it has listed a Space and identified itself as a Host. In all other cases, SND only acts as an intermediary. The site allows users to connect, agree on applicable terms and then enter into a comprehensive, legally-binding agreement (“Agreement”).

            Fees payable for using the Services include the fee payable by the Guest to the Host for use of the Space (“Storage Fees”), the fee payable to SND by both the Host and Guest for use of the services (“SND Service Fee”) and the fee for Insurance. These fees together are referred to as “Total Fees”. The Storage Fee, SND Service Fee and the Insurance Fee, may be adjusted from time to time.

            Upon acceptance of the Agreement between Host and a Guest, SND will collect Total Fees plus an additional one month of Storage Fees as Security Deposit from the Guest. All financial transactions between the parties will be processed by a third-party electronic payment system. By using the payment system, you confirm that you have read and agree to the terms and conditions applying to that service.

            Each listing of a Space by a Host is an offer to enter a legally binding Agreement with a Guest, also referred to as a Booking. If the Guest accepts the offer through the Website or App, they are considered to have accepted the terms of the listing and the Total Fees are collected from the Guest. In the event that the Total Fees are not collected, the Booking is considered invalid.

            If you as the Host use the Services on behalf of a company or other organisation, you represent and warrant that you are authorised to bind such company or organisation to these Terms and to act on behalf of such company with respect to any actions you take in connection with the Services and, in such event, “you” and “your” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity. You agree to respond promptly and completely to requests from SND for additional information that SND deems necessary to determine your authority to act on behalf of a company or organisation. SND may suspend or terminate your access to the Services and your account if SND has reason to believe that you are not authorised to act on behalf of the company or organization for whom you claim to be acting in connection with the Services.

            As a Host, you may create Listings. To create a Listing, the Host must describe the Space, along with any house rules they wish to apply, on the listing page of the Website. Such description will include text, graphics, pictures and other relevant content and should include details like size, location, security and access offered. The Host will also state the Storage Fee for the space. All information must be accurate, complete, up-to-date and truthful to the best of your knowledge.

            Listings will be made publicly available via our Website, smartphone application (App) and Services. Guests will be able to book your space via the Website, App and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a guest requests a Booking of your Space, the price for the Booking may not be altered.

                  By creating a Listing you represent and warrant you have sufficient rights in and to the Space to participate in the Service as a Host, and your participation in the Service as a Host will not violate or result in the breach of any agreement between you and any third party, including any lease agreement or other agreement relating to the Space and that any Space you offer for bookings hereunder is:
                lists: ['free of any known conditions or defects that would pose a hazard or risk to the safety of any User;', 'clean and ready to use at the start of each booking period;', 'in a safe condition and in compliance with law and any applicable building requirements;', 'does not violate any lease or other agreements relating to the Space or any building policies, and you are solely responsible for and shall indemnify SND against any fines, losses or other liability arising from such violations; and', 'the Space will be available as agreed between you and the Guest.  In the event that the Space becomes unavailable for any reason, you agree to remove or suspend the Listing as soon as reasonably practicable.']
            - content: |
                Guests will be charged Total Fees on a recurring 30-day basis. SND will collect Total Fees and initiate payment of the Storage Fees to the Host every ten (10) days of each 30 day booking period. You authorise SND, on behalf of the Host, to collect the Total Fees associated with the applicable recurring 30-day basis. SND will continue to collect Total Fees on a recurring basis until the Guest and Host confirm termination of the Booking.

                Hosts agree to never insist, ask or imply to a Guest that they pay any or all of the Fees directly to the Host with any payment method other than by payment through SND and its payment system.

                Hosts may terminate the Booking by providing 30 days' notice (“Notice Period”) in writing to the Guest through SND of your intention to terminate the Booking.  By terminating the Booking, you acknowledge that you are breaking the terms of the Agreement, agree to let the Guest continue to use the Space for the Notice Period and forfeit the Storage Fees payable to you for the period of the Notice Period.  Please click <a href="termination_policy">here</a> to see the Termination Policy.

                If, as a Host, you have reasonable suspicion that a Guest is in breach of these Terms Of Service, you should immediately notify SND. Depending on the circumstances, we may simply require the Guest to remedy the breach, or we may terminate the Booking and require the Guest to remove their items. The Host shall provide reasonable notice and opportunity for the Guest to cure any breach or vacate if they cannot. If necessary, SND may inform law enforcement authorities or take actions to remove items from the Space if there is an immediate threat to persons or property.

                  Upon termination, if the Guest does not remove such items upon reasonable notice, or they fail to reclaim their goods upon expiry of the Agreement (“Abandoned Goods”) such items may be removed by SND.  A Host is entitled to sell or dispose of Abandoned Goods where:
                lists: ['the Host first notifies SND, with full particulars of the Abandoned Goods;', 'the Host follows all reasonable directions of SND;', 'having regard to the circumstances of the default or abandonment, SND will, at our absolute discretion, direct the Host to remit or retain any remaining proceeds of sale.']

                lists: ['will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties and not conflict with the rights of such third parties', 'will be in compliance with all applicable laws, tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Space included in a Listing you post.']

                Please note that SND assumes no responsibility for a User’s compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations. SND reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that SND, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to our Website, App or Services.

                You understand and agree that SND does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent for you as a Host. If a Guest requests a Booking of your Space and attends at your Space, any Agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the guest and SND is not a party thereto.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, SND serves as the limited authorised agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting payments from Guests on behalf of the Host and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Host.  Each Host is responsible for determining applicable taxes and for including any applicable taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable taxes in their Listings.

                You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who work at or are otherwise present at the Space at your request or invitation.

            Each listing by a Host is an offer to enter a legally binding Agreement with a Guest.  If the Guest accepts the offer through the Website or App, they are considered to have accepted the terms of the listing and the Fees are collected from the Guest.  In the event that the Fees are not collected, the Booking is considered invalid.

            The Guest undertakes to pay the Fees promptly, fully and in good faith and using the SND payment function, upon confirmation of the Agreement with the Host and for each subsequent month’s usage of the Space.

            Guests will be charged Total Fees on a recurring 30-day basis. SND will collect Total Fees and initiate payment of the Storage Fees to the Host every ten (10) days of each 30 day booking period. You authorise SND, on behalf of the Host, to collect the Total Fees associated with the applicable recurring 30-day basis. SND will continue to collect Total Fees on a recurring basis until the Guest and Host confirm termination of the Booking.

            Guests may terminate the Booking by providing 16 days’ notice (“Notice Period”) in writing to the Host through the SND Website of your intention to vacate the Space.  You must continue to pay Total Fees for the whole Notice Period, regardless of whether you have vacated or removed your belongings in that period.  The Host will receive the Storage Fee for the entire Notice Period. Please click <a href="termination_policy">here</a> to see the Termination Policy.

            Similarly, Hosts may terminate the booking by providing 30 days&#39; notice (“Notice Period”) in writing to the Guest through SND of their intention to terminate the Booking.  By terminating the Booking, they acknowledge that they are breaking the terms of the Agreement, agree to let the Guest continue to use the Space for the Notice Period and forfeit the Storage Fees payable to them for the period of the Notice Period.

            At or before the end of the Booking period or upon terminating the Agreement in keeping with these terms, the Guest must vacate the Space completely. The Guest must remove all contents and debris and leave the Space in good and tenantable condition.

            Guests agree to never insist, ask or imply to a Host that they pay any or all of the Fees directly to the Host with any payment method other than by payment through SND.

            If a Host has reasonable suspicion that a Guest is in breach of these Storage terms, the Host may terminate the Booking and require the Guest to remove their items.  The Host shall provide reasonable notice and opportunity for the Guest to cure any breach or vacate if they cannot.  If necessary, SND may inform law enforcement authorities or take actions to remove items from their Space.

            Guests can cancel their Booking prior to moving in, according to the Cancellation Policy.  Please click <a href="cancellation_policy">here</a> to see the Cancellation Policy.  In the event a Guest cancels a Booking, SND shall transfer to the Host the Fees collected by SND from the Guest, minus SND’s Service Fee and any penalty fee, in accordance with the selected cancellation policy. When a cancellation is confirmed, SND will refund the remaining monies to the Guest.  Hosts should not cancel a confirmed Booking.  If however, exceptional circumstances require the Host to cancel a Booking, please notify SND for assistance.

            SND has the right to cancel any Booking at any time for security or fraud-protection purposes.  This is generally due to our fraud-detection processes reporting a problem with the payment card submitted.  In such cases the cancellation policy will not apply and Hosts will receive no payment for the cancelled Booking
